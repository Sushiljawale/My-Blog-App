            <p>Generally, most websites (even blogs) do require a Privacy Policy and a Terms 
                 of Service. These legal agreements are required if certain criteria are met 
                  by the blog owner.
             <br>   However, the criteria are such that most blogs will end up on the side of 
              needing these legal agreements in place.   <br>           
                Most blogs have features such as comment forms so that bloggers can easily 
                 connect to other people and fellow bloggers. This means that blogs collect at 
                  least some personal information from visitors: the email address. <br>
                  A Privacy Policy is required by the law if you collect personal information 
                   from users, regardless if it's just one email address or not.
                  This kind of agreement needs to cover all the important details of how your 
                   blog website collects and uses personal data from visiting users.</p> <br>
